\begin{abstract}

\noindent In the current era of partisan polarization, there is concern that partisanship that strongly colors partisans' worldview. But does it cause us to \textit{see} things differently \citep{chabris2010invisible}? We test the hypotheses in three different experiments and consistently find that the effect is at worst small.
\end{abstract}

\doublespacing

Partisans are increasingly polarized \cite{IyengarSoodLelkes2012} with partisan cleavages outstripping some of the longer standing racial cleavages. 

In this paper, we explore whether polarization affects . We test this with some simple evaluative tasks---finding errors---with subtle cues about party.

\section{Data and Research Design}

\citep{chabris2010invisible}

To assess how partisans `see', we surveyed a nationally representative sample of people selected by YouGov \citep{rivers2007} as part of a Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) module. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we changed one single word (democratic/republican) to change who respondents thought wrote a piece of text (see Figure~\ref{fig:mistakes_dem} and Republicans \ref{fig:mistakes_rep}). We then asked ``How many errors did you count?''

In the second survey, we showed people a photo of a parking lot and asked them to estimate the number of poorly parked cars. We manipulated which party's members were using the parking lot. 

On a survey on M-Turk, we asked respondents to watch a short video and estimate how many people in the video were wearing masks. In particular, our directions were as follows:

``Please watch the following short (10-second) video. You will be asked a question about it on the next screen. ...How many people in the video were wearing masks?''

\section{Results}

As Table~\ref{tab:tab1} shows, Democrats find 9.7 mistakes when they think the text is written by a Democrat compared to 9.9 mistakes when they think the text is written by a Republican. On the other hand, Republicans find 8.4 mistakes on average when they think the text is written by a Democrat and 8.1 mistakes when they think it is written by a Republican. And while the differences are consistent with the point about partisan bias, the main point is about the smallness of the differences.
