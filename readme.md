## Partisan Vision? Impact of Partisanship on Visual Evaluative Tasks

Do partisans see things differently? We test the hypothesis with two different experiments and a survey. In the experiments, we manipulate who has [written a piece of text](data/treats/Mistakes_Dem.png), or [parked the cars](data/treats/Parking_Lot_Dems.png) and ask respondents to estimate the number of errors. And on the survey question, we ask respondents to count [how many people are wearing a mask at a Trump rally](data/treats/trump_rally.mp4). We find that the differences are consistently small.
